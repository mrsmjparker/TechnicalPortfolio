# Technical Portfolio - Updated September 2023
**I am seeking my lifelong dream job that includes (but is not limited to) one or more of the following:</br>
-Manager/Director of Technical Training</br>
-Technical Writing (including How-To Guides, Videos, Cheat Sheets, and more)</br>
-Collaboration with fellow Internal and External programmers for the purposes of documentation of code, APIs, SOPs, and BRDs</br>
-Learn and Turn - my personal coined phrase for learning fast and turning knowledge around to others</br>
-Cloud Administration (including Azure, AWS, and SharePoint/365)
-Document Management</br>
-Troubleshooting & Testing code, including deployments</br>
-People Management and Mentoring. </br>
-SAP Testing/Documentation/Training</br>
</br>
Below is a collection of writing samples for anyone who wants a high-energy, motivated, loyal, experienced, people person to add value to their company. I live in Mesa, AZ, but currently work East Coast hours, and am willing to work in any Time Zone. My experience has taken me all over the world to teach and present at Microsoft Conferences in front of thousands, and also to tiny, virtual classrooms. As my profile says "I can make high-tech clear to anyone - even my Mom".  The thing I am most proud of is that I have elevated humankind in every way possible through the use of technology.**

Work Samples <br/>
Please note: Packable shut its doors on August 22, 2022 - much of the sampling you will see was proprietary but can now be included here<br/>
